Phone Purchase Calculation
==========================

Objective
---------

- [X] Write a program to calculate the total price of your phone purchase.
- [x] You will keep purchasing phones (hint: loop!) until you run out of money in your bank account.
- [X] You will also buy accessories for each phone as long as your purchase amount is below your mental spending threshold.
- [X] After you have calculated your purchase amount, add in the tax, then print out
the calculated purchase amount, properly formatted.
- [x] Finally, check the amount against your bank account balance to see if you can
afford it or not.
- [X] You should set up some constants for:
      * "tax rate"
      * "phone price"
      * "accessory price"
      * "spending threshold"
      * as well as a variable for your "bank account balance"
- [X] You should define functions for calculating the tax and for formatting the
price with a "$" and rounding to two decimal places.
- [] Bonus Challenge:  Try to incorporate input into this program, perhaps with the
prompt(...).  You may prompt the user for their bank account balance, for example.
